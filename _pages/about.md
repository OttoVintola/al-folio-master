Hello, I'm Otto. I like exploring computers with smart friends.

I come from a computer science background with 1 - 2 years of data science experience in ML and software engineering. I'm currently working as a TA for the [CS Department](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-computer-science) at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/fi). Also, during the summer I work for [Nokia](https://www.nokia.com) developing and deploying software systems. 

At [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/fi), I'm pursuing my bachelor's in Data Science with a minor in Industrial Engineering and Management. Some notable courses I enjoyed: [Machine Learning](https://courses.aalto.fi/s/course/a053X000012QzLnQAK/machine-learning-d?language=sv), [Deep Learning](https://courses.aalto.fi/s/course/a053X000012QyXgQAK/deep-learning-d?language=en_US), [Linear Algebra](https://courses.aalto.fi/s/course/a057T000009637iQAA/linear-algebra?language=en_US), [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://courses.aalto.fi/s/course/a053X000012QxXKQA0/data-structures-and-algorithms?language=en_US) and [Databases](https://courses.aalto.fi/s/course/a057T0000043wFPQAY/databases-for-data-science?language=fi). In the Aalto ecosystem I like to partake in the biggest hackathon in Europe [Junction](https://www.hackjunction.com), and a business case-competition [Deep Dive](https://www.deep-dive.org). 

Before Aalto, I explored computer science by building networks (VPNs and servers) on microcontrollers and embedded systems with C on [RaspberryPis](https://www.raspberrypi.com). During middle school and high school I dedicated time to mathematics and received technological innovation scholarships.

Nowadays, I like to keep my daily life scheduled while still finding time to hang out with my family and friends.
